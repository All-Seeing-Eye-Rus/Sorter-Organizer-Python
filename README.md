# Sorter-Organizer-Python
This code allows you to easily and quickly sort files into the desired directories.

This code will help organize order on your device. Or a project, which is often very convenient, since you do not need to look for the necessary directory with the necessary files every time and transfer another copy to it.

Before applying this code, I had to move files through folders myselfüëé

But after using it, you will save a lot of time, especially if you have a large amount of files or a large projectüëç
