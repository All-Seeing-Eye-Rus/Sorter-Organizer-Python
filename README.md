# Sorter-Organizer-Python
This code allows you to easily and quickly sort files into the desired directories.

This code will help organize order on your device. Or a project, which is often very convenient, since you do not need to look for the necessary directory with the necessary files every time and transfer another copy to it.

One of my first small projects, I ask you to notify me by mail in case of a malfunction: prodam.avto@internet.ru
